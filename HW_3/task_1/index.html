    <div><h1>Friends sitcom</h1></div>
    <div>
        <p class="par-one">Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September
        22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa
        Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who
        live in Manhattan, New York City. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with
        Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.</p>
        <p class="par-two">Series creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being "the
        first true 'ensemble' show." The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to
        dominate; they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective salary
        negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season. The cast members also
        became best friends off-screen, so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt
        left out.</p>

        <p class="par-three">The cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox
        and David Arquette's daughter, Coco. In the official farewell commemorative book Friends <span>'Til the End, each
        separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.</span></p>
