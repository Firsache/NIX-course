            <h1>The Royal Family</h1>
            <p>
                The <b>British royal family</b> comprises King <i>Charles III</i> and his close relations. There is no strict legal or formal
                definition of who is or is not a member, although the Royal Household has issued different lists outlining who is a part
                of the royal family.[1][2] They support the monarch in undertaking public engagements and often pursue charitable work
                and interests. The royal family are regarded as British cultural icons.

            <h3>Public role</h3>
            <p>
                During the reign of <a href="/index2.html"><b>Queen Elizabeth II</b></a>, official duties were undertaken on her behalf by her children and their spouses,
                grandchildren and their spouses, and cousins and their spouses. Among her cousins, only the children of King George V's
                sons carry out royal engagements. The family supported the Queen in her state and national duties, with the exception of
                constitutional functions.
            </p>
            <h3>Residences</h3>
            <p>
                The monarch's official residence in London is <a href="/index3.html"><b>Buckingham Palace.</b></a> Announcements of the births and deaths of members
                of the royal family are traditionally attached to its front railings. Queen Elizabeth II's Scottish residence was
                the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where she resided at the beginning of each summer. While in Northern Ireland,
                Hillsborough Castle serves as a residence for members of the royal family.
