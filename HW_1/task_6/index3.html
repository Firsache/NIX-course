        <p>
            The <b>British royal family</b> comprises King <i>Charles III</i> and his close relations. There is no
            strict legal or formal
            definition of who is or is not a member, although the Royal Household has issued different lists outlining
            who is a part
            of the royal family. They support the monarch in undertaking public engagements and often pursue
            charitable work
            and interests. The royal family are regarded as British cultural icons.

        <h3>The Royal Family</h3>
        <p>
            During the reign of <b>Queen Elizabeth II</b>, official duties were undertaken on her behalf by her children
            and their spouses,
            grandchildren and their spouses, and cousins and their spouses. Among her cousins, only the children of King
            George V's
            sons carry out royal engagements. The family supported the Queen in her state and national duties, with the
            exception of
            constitutional functions.<br>
