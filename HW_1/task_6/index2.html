        <h1>Queen Elizabeth II</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>British royal family</b> comprises King <i>Charles III</i> and his close relations. There is no
            strict legal or formal
            definition of who is or is not a member, although the Royal Household has issued different lists outlining
            who is a part
            of the royal family.[1][2] They support the monarch in undertaking public engagements and often pursue
            charitable work
            and interests. The royal family are regarded as British cultural icons.
